# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [3.24.0] - 2024-07-11

### Added

### Removed

### Changed

### Fixed

- Update uplink policy at codec degradation triggered by encoding health monitor.

## [3.23.0] - 2024-05-14

### Added

- Added `DefaultDeviceController.suspendAudioContext` and `DefaultDeviceController.resumeAudioContext`. Suspending and resuming the resusable audio context is preferable to stopping and recreating if an audio context eventually needs to be used again.

### Removed

### Changed

- Do not try to manually adjust SVC layers based off target resolution, as this may lead to an unnecessarily high minimum bitrate to subscribe to all remote videos. Instead rely on browser logic which drops any layers below around 135p.

### Fixed

- Fixed rare race conditions with simulcast + server side network adaptation on third attendee join.
- Make redundant audio worker code generation script work on Windows
- Do not drop server side network adaptation pauses that happen immediately after SDP negotiation, by pre-emptively creating a tile immediately when applications subscribes to one, and attaching the video track later.

## [3.22.0] - 2024-03-15

### Added

- Add automatic codec degradation logic when CPU usage of software encoder is high or video encoding of encoder fails. This will only occur if `setVideoCodecSendPreferences` is being called by the application.
- Added `groupId` to `VideoTileState` for mapping metrics other then those from `getObservableVideoMetrics` when using server side network adaptation.
- Added support for Node version 22

### Removed

### Changed

- Avoid subscribes when simulcast is enabled but not currently sending, or when using server side network adaptation.
- Made server side network adaptation the default when creating `VideoPriorityBasedPolicy`.

### Fixed

- Fixed reconnections not triggering `audioVideoWasDemotedFromPrimaryMeeting`.

## [3.21.1] - 2024-03-28

### Added

### Removed

### Changed

### Fixed

- Fixed packets received check on Safari 17.3 and below

## [3.21.0] - 2024-02-12

### Added

### Removed

### Changed

- Simplified simulcast uplink policy to not unnecesarily try to compensate for uplink bandwidth estimation.
- Avoid unnecessary transceiver creation by using no-video policy for content share.

### Fixed

- Fixed unnecessary cropping on some camera capturers when simulcast was enabled.

## [3.20.0] - 2023-12-12

### Added

- Add support for node 20 and drop support for node < 18.
- Add support for H.264 profiles besides Constrained Baseline Profile.
- Fix MeetingReadinessChecker demo by checking for audio `kind`

### Removed

### Changed

### Fixed

- Fix reconnections when setting audio Attendee Capability to 'None' or 'Send' mid call. The connection health monitor will now look at all packets received on all candidate pairs instead of just audio received media packets.
- Setup passthrough streams for insertable streams case in the redundant audio worker so that passthrough streams do not get blocked on the main thread.
- Disable redundant audio for Chrome 106 and earlier to fix video decoder failure on old Chrome versions with redundant audio turned on.

## [3.19.0] - 2023-09-20

### Added
- Add support for high-definition WebRTC sessions with 1080p webcam video and 4K screen share. Developers can choose video encoding bitrates up to 2.5Mbps, frame rates up to 30fps, and the codec, including new options VP9, AV1, and scalable video coding (SVC).
- Update AWS SDK version to 3.477.0

### Removed

### Changed
- Revert: Improve reconnection behavior on signaling disconnection mid call or during join/subscribe. This was leading to unexpected `AudioJoinedFromAnotherDevice` events in certain edge conditions. It will be re-released in a later version.

### Fixed
- Prevent video processing with filters from being throttled when an attendees meeting tab moves into the background.
- Do not allow redundant audio worker to enqueue any audio payloads larger than 1000 bytes to avoid permanently stopping the audio flow.
- Make uplink loss estimation more accurate so that redundant audio does not turn off prematurely.

## [3.18.2] - 2023-10-09

### Added

### Removed

### Changed

### Fixed
- Save the redundant audio worker code during build time so that the worker code stays intact and is able to be loaded

## [3.18.1] - 2023-09-29

### Added

### Removed

### Changed

### Fixed
- Fixed bug that prevented sending and receiving audio, video, and content share when using Simulcast and Redundant Audio at the same time

## [3.18.0] - 2023-09-11

### Added
- Support sending and receiving redundant audio data to help reduce the effects of packet loss on audio quality. See README for more details.
- Send a few additional metrics to backend

### Removed

### Changed

### Fixed
- Fixed audio send failing for the rest of the meeting when writing frames larger than 1000 bytes in Chrome, which could be caused by sending redundant audio

## [3.17.0] - 2023-08-15

### Added

- Allow receiving notification messages from server and print messages received to console
- Add a new meeting event, `deviceLabelTriggerFailed`, for device label trigger failures. By default, the Chime SDK for JavaScript requests access to the microphone and camera in order to retrieve device labels. The SDK will send the `deviceLabelTriggerFailed` event when either the microphone, camera or both requests fail. (Before this PR, the SDK would emit `audioInputFailed` and `videoInputFailed` events simultaneously, which could lead to confusion.) If a custom function is supplied with `meetingSession.audioVideo.setDeviceLabelTrigger`, the SDK will send this event when the custom function is not successful.

### Removed
- Resolution constraint for content share

- Remove unused legacy TURN credentials path.

### Changed
- Improve reconnection behavior on signaling disconnection mid call or during join/subscribe

### Fixed

- Do not display a warning message when invoking `meetingSession.audioVideo.setVideoCodecSendPreferences` prior to the start of the session.

## [3.16.0] - 2023-06-26

### Added

### Removed

- Remove max video bandwidth in guide.

### Changed

- Added recommendations to use server side network adaptation, and clarified support on all browsers. Removed demo features and information on network adaptation configuration that is not used when server side network adaptation is used.
- Set `esModuleInterop` to `true` in tsconfig.json, and update several import statements.
- Update documentation reference to chime-sdk.
- Add RTC Speak/Mic Audio Level in proto file
- Add `audioUpstreamLevel`, `audioDownstreamLevel` to the `ClientMetricReport`

### Fixed

- Bump protobufjs from 6.11.3 to 7.2.4.
- Fixed usage of `this` in `VideoCodecCapability` constructors.
- Fixed a race condition error if calling `startContentShare` then `stopContentShare` right after.
- Invoke MediaStreamBrokerObservers in the next event loop tick to prevent race conditions with the browser's `RTCRtpSender.replaceTrack` API call.

## [3.15.0] - 2023-05-01

### Added

- Set max bitrate to 1500kbps.
- Add resolution constraint to content share (1080p@30fps).
- Added opt-in server side network adaption enablement flag `ServerSideNetworkAdaption.BandwidthProbingAndRemoteVideoQualityAdaption`. See [this section in the guide](https://aws.github.io/amazon-chime-sdk-js/modules/prioritybased_downlink_policy.html#server-side-network-adaption) for more details.
- Content share issue with above change

### Removed

### Changed

- Clarify quotas for content-sharing publishing and subscriptions in API Overview.
- Fallback `majorVersion()` to `-1` if `version` is `null` in `DefaultBrowserBehavior`.

### Removed

### Changed

- Update chime sdk messaging client version.

### Fixed

## [3.14.0] - 2023-04-11

### Fixed

## [3.13.0] - 2023-03-28

### Added

- Send client utc offset with attendee JOIN frame over signalling channel.
- Add an unified interface (videofx processor) with new implementation for ML features, namely background blur 2.0 and background replacement 2.0. This includes improvement to the underlying model for better segmentation, better image processing algorithms to blur the background, and other miscellanies bug-fixes/features.

### Removed

### Changed

- Evaluate `SendingAudioFailureConnectionHealthPolicy` only after getting connected i.e. after `audioVideoDidStart()` is called. This avoids false positive triggers of `sendingAudioFailed` at the start of a meeting session.

### Fixed

## [3.12.0] - 2023-02-14

### Added

### Removed

### Changed

### Fixed

- Refactored various state cleanup to `AudioVideoControllerState.resetConnectionSpecificState`.
- Update `supportsCanvasCapturedStreamPlayback` in `DefaultBrowserBehavior` to fix background blur and replacement
  support check failures in iPad.

## [3.11.0] - 2023-01-03

### Added

- Added flag `disablePeriodicKeyframeRequestOnContentSender` to `MeetingSessionConfiguration` for applications that would like to experiment with disabling the 10 second keyframe request interval which is default on the backend.

### Removed

### Changed

- To support future use case of allowing users to join a meeting without the need for a microphone or empty audio stream, update `checkAudioConnectivity` logic inside `DefaultMeetingReadinessChecker` accordingly, to check for audio packets received metrics using `metricsDidReceive` observer in addition to attendee presence condition. Previously, the audio connectivity check used to implicitly test that audio was being sent out from the client and being received by the server. Now this check will include a test for attendee presence, showing that the signal connection has been established, and audio packets being received, showing that the data connection has been established.

### Fixed

- Fix ES2015 target builds by fixing voicefocus js file.
- Added missing state cleanup for various video components on reconnect to mitigate missing remote or local video.

## [3.10.0] - 2022-11-02

### Added

- Add `destroy()` method to `VoiceFocus` class.
- Add `destroyVoiceFocus` method to `VoiceFocusDeviceTransformer` class.
- Add guide to show how to use the `destroyVoiceFocus` method in the `VoiceFocusDeviceTransformer` class.

### Removed

### Changed

- Update documentation for `MeetingSessionStatusCode` to clarify the origin and meaning of each. Included information on use of `isTerminal` flag to determine if retry will be automatically attempted.

### Fixed

- Fix codec intersection logic to avoid unnecessary renegotiations.

## [3.9.0] - 2022-09-21

### Added

- Add the audio output gain and frequency to the meeting readiness checker's configuration. The readiness checker uses this value to set the "Play Tone" gain and frequency.
- Add support for background filter starting from iOS 16 for major browsers Safari, Chrome, and Firefox (except on iPad).

### Removed

### Changed

- Add metric derived from string metric in metric report.
- Send `audioInputFailed` and `videoInputFailed` if there is error getting device labels.
- Updated `DefaultVideoFrameProcessorPipeline` to clone audio tracks to the output `MediaStream` instead of dropping them. This allows more straightforward usage of the pipeline on content sharing like file playback.

### Fixed

- Fixed missing videos, or unnecessarily long freezes when switching simulcast streams.

## [3.8.0] - 2022-08-18

### Added

- Add encoder/decoder is in hardware metric and stream dimension to signaling protocol
- Report encode/decode time and if encoder/decoder is in hardware, and add encoder/decoder name as a metric dimension

### Removed

### Changed

- Fix a confusing function name from `millisecondsPerSecond` to `averageTimeSpentPerSecondInMilliseconds`.
- Move `requiresPlaybackLatencyHintForAudioContext` to `ExtendedBrowserBehavior`.

### Fixed

- `MessagingSession` reconnect loop did not break on error past reconnect deadline. Infinite reconnect loop was caused due to `firstConnectionAttemptTimestamp` not being set as `startedConnectionAttempt` was not invoked. Check <https://github.com/aws/amazon-chime-sdk-js/issues/2372> for details.
- `MessagingSession` `getMessagingSessionEndpoint` call is now backwards compatible with AWS JS SDK v2.
- Use a default "playback" `latencyHint` when creating the `AudioContext` on Windows. Also adds a `setDefaultLatencyHint` API to `DefaultDeviceController` to allow for overriding.
- Fix behavior of websocket disconnects before a session is connected. Session.start() promise shall fail in the scenario.
- Queue messages before a messaging session is established to avoid dropping them.

## [3.7.0] - 2022-07-05

### Added

- Add support in `MessagingSession` to allow websocket connection for messaging service to select sort by for Prefetch.
- Added two new meeting events: `sendingAudioFailed` to indicate a failure in sending audio packets out and `sendingAudioRecovered` to indicate recovery after a `sendingAudioFailed` event.
- Added a new `ConnectionHealthPolicy` named `SendingAudioFailureConnectionHealthPolicy` to evaluate and trigger the above events. Also, added `sendingAudioFailureSamplesToConsider` and `sendingAudioFailureInitialWaitTimeMs` to `ConnectionHealthPolicyConfiguration` fields for configuring the new health policy.
- Added a new field `consecutiveStatsWithNoAudioPacketsSent` in `ConnectionHealthData` for evaluating the `SendingAudioFailureConnectionHealthPolicy`.

### Removed

### Changed

- Update package.json to include Node 18.
- Refactored `connectionHealthDidChange()` in `MonitorTask` by creating a new `applyHealthPolicy()` method to reduce redundancy in the health policy evaluation.
- Modified `SignalingAndMetricsConnectionMonitor` to update `consecutiveStatsWithNoAudioPacketsSent`.
- Reset `connectionHealthData` on every connect (as opposed to doing it only when `signalingClient` is not initialized). This allows us to honor the cool-down time in both `SendingAudioFailureConnectionHealthPolicy` and `UnusableAudioWarningConnectionHealthPolicy` in case when the connection is failing due to an error like "no ice candidates were gathered".

### Fixed

- Fix `AbortError` when turning video ON in Safari.
- `MessagingSession` reconnects with refreshed endpoint and credentials if needed.  `EndpointUrl` on `MessagingSessionConfiguration` is deprecated as it is resolved by calling `getMessagingSessionEndpoint` internally.

## [3.6.0] - 2022-06-23

### Added

- Add a new API `enableSimulcastForContentShare` to enable simulcast for content share so that content share could be shown in network constrained clients. The lower quality layer has 300 kbps max bitrate, resolution scale factor of 2, and 5 max framerate.
- Add APIs `setVideoCodecSendPreferences` and `setContentShareVideoCodecPreferences` to allow configuration of codec being used to send. See the [JS SDK guide](https://aws.github.io/amazon-chime-sdk-js/modules/videocodecs.html) for more details.
- Added tracer logs to missing subscribe and unsubscribe methods.
- Added opt-in server side network adaption enablement flag `ServerSideNetworkAdaption.EnableBandwidthProbing`. See [this section in the guide](https://aws.github.io/amazon-chime-sdk-js/modules/prioritybased_downlink_policy.html#server-side-network-adaption) for more details.

### Removed

### Changed

### Fixed

- Fix issue closing a web worker in Amazon Voice Focus's inline worklet.

## [3.5.0] - 2022-06-02

### Added

- Add a workaround for <https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=241152> to play a paused video element in Safari.

### Removed

### Changed

- Bump `protobufjs` from 6.8.8 to 6.11.3.
- Update `DOMBlobMock` to accommodate `@types/node` changes.

### Fixed

- Fix issue where Amazon Voice Focus stops working after changing device while muted.
- Remove the `isChanged` flag as it breaks some old muting funtionality causing Amazon Voice Focus to stop working.
- Fix issue where Amazon Voice Focus could stop working after changing the mute state of a null device or changing the device shortly after.
- Fix an issue for mute local when there is no audio input.
- Fix trucation of video subscriptions not occuring if the resubscribe was driven by `MonitorTask`.
- Fix protobuf generation script for upgrade.
- Optional chain signaling client observer removal to fix [issue](https://github.com/aws/amazon-chime-sdk-js/issues/2265) if  `audioVideo.stop()` is called before `audioVideo.start()`.

## [3.4.0] - 2022-05-24

### Added

- Add the reserved status code AudioDisconnectAudio.
- Add support in `MessagingSession` to allow websocket connection for messaging service to enable Prefetch feature.

### Removed

### Changed

- Add reset function to uplink policy interface, and ignore indexes in nscale policy if the number of published videos did not change.

### Fixed

- Rate limited CPU warnings to at most once a minute in Voice Focus library, so that builder logs are not flooded.

## [3.3.0] - 2022-05-12

### Added

- Add support for hosting meetings in US GovCloud regions.
- Add support for starting live transcription in US GovCloud regions.

### Removed

### Changed

- Assume SDP section is sendrecv if no direction is present. This should have no impact on media negotiation.

### Fixed

- Replace `startVideoInput(null)` and `startAudioInput(null)` with`stopVideoInput` and `stopAudioInput` for video, audio test in meeting readiness checker to stop video, audio input.
- Replace the deprecated API `getRTCPeerConnectionStats` with `metricsDidReceive` in meeting readiness checker.
- Prevent `realtimeUnsubscribeFromVolumeIndicator` from causing a fatal error when there are no subscriptions for the `attendeeId`.
- Subscribe to `audioOutputDidChange` in audio mix controller to fix the issue where the audio output is not updated before meeting start.

## [3.2.0] - 2022-04-27

### Added

- Add browser support information to content share guide.
- Readd layers allocation negotiation in Chromium based browsers to avoid resubscribing to preemptively turn off simulcast streams or to switch layers. Avoid duplicate RTP header extension and changing extension id.

### Removed

### Changed

- Clean up the HTML video element bounded to `VideoTileState` using `unbindVideoElement` API to fix Safari memory leak. If you do not intend to clean the video element, call `unbindVideoElement` API with `cleanUpVideoElement` set to `false`. Check [PR#2217](https://github.com/aws/amazon-chime-sdk-js/pull/2217) for detailed information.

### Fixed

- Fix issue where video resolution and framerate changes when toggle video transform.

## [3.1.0] - 2022-04-07

- Add `videoUpstreamRoundTripTimeMs`, `videoUpstreamJitterMs`, and `videoDownstreamJitterMs`, and `videoDownstreamDelayMs` to `observableVideoMetricSpec`.

### Removed

- No longer stop video stream when calling `stopLocalVideoTile`. This was added as a workaround to prevent crash in old Safari versions but no longer needed.

### Changed

- Subscribe and unsubscribe to `MediaStreamBrokerObserver` in `AudioVideoController` at the end of every connection and disconnection to avoid trying to replace local audio and video during connection.
- Update `getMediaType` method to check the property `kind` instead of `mediaType` of a `RawMetricReport`.

### Fixed

- Fixed state not being reset if an `AudioVideoController` is reused after `stop`.

- Fix a bug that `remote-inbound-rtp` `RTCStatsReport` and `remote-outbound-rtp` `RTCStatsReport` of "video" `kind` are accidentally filtered.
- Fix the incorrect calculation of aggregation WebRTC metric spec (`audioSpeakerDelayMs`, `decoderLoss`).

## [3.0.0] - 2022-03-30

Amazon Chime SDK for JavaScript v3 is here !! 🎉🎉🎉

Amazon Chime SDK for JavaScript v3 includes major improvements for device management, WebRTC metrics, and the
messaging session.

- **Device management:** Decouple audio and video device management from the meeting sessions. For example, a user can select their preferred devices on a video preview page and continue using the same devices to join the session. After joining the session, a user can instantly switch devices without interrupting the ongoing meeting session.
- **WebRTC metrics:** Publish the standardized WebRTC metrics for all supported browsers.
- **Messaging session:** Add support for AWS SDK for JavaScript v3 for messaging session.
- **Dropping support:** Deprecate Safari 12 support and Plan B in Session Description Protocol (SDP) negotiations.

Below is a list of all changes in the Chime SDK for JavaScript v3. Please refer to the [Migraton guide from v2 to v3](https://aws.github.io/amazon-chime-sdk-js/modules/migrationto_3_0.html) for
more information.

### Added

- Add `rtcStatsReport` property to `ClientMetricReport` to store raw [`RTCStatsReport`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCStatsReport) and expose it via `metricsDidReceive` event.

### Removed

- Remove support for Plan B as well as Safari (and iOS) 12+. The minimum Safari and iOS supported version is now 13.
- Remove [legacy (non-promise-based) `getStats` API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCPeerConnection/getStats#obsolete_syntax) call in `DefaultStatsCollector`. This API was previously used to obtain WebRTC metrics only for Chromium-based browsers. Now SDK obtains WebRTC metrics for all browsers via [standardized (promise-based) `getStats` API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCPeerConnection/getStats#syntax).
- Remove all deprecated meeting status code.
- Remove `videoSendHealthDidChange`, `videoSendBandwidthDidChange`, `videoNotReceivingEnoughData`, and `videoReceiveBandwidthDidChange`. Use `metricsDidReceive` to obtain metrics instead.
- Remove `estimatedDownlinkBandwidthLessThanRequired`.
- Remove synthesize video APIs such as SMTP.
- Removed SDP interface.
- Remove `StatsCollector` interface.
- Remove `ClientMetricReport` interface.

### Changed

- Rename `DefaultStatsCollector` to `StatsCollector`.
- Rename `DefaultClientMetricReport` to `ClientMetricReport`.
- Change `chooseAudioInputDevice` to explicit APIs `startAudioInput` and `stopAudioInput`. Application will need to
  call `stopVideoInput` at the end of the call to explicitly stop active audio stream.
- Change `chooseVideoInputDevice` to explicit APIs `startVideoInput` and `stopVideoInput`. Application will need to
  call `stopVideoInput` now to explicitly stop active video stream.
- Minor name change to `chooseAudioOutputDevice` to `chooseAudioOutput`.
- `startVideoPreviewForVideoInput` and `stopVideoPreviewForVideoInput` will no longer turn on and off video stream.
  This allows applications to join meeting without reselecting video again.
- Remove max bandwidth kbps parameter in `chooseVideoInputQuality` as it is not related to device. Applications can
  set video max bandwidth kbps from `audioVideo.setVideoMaxBandwidthKbps`.
- Extend the `DeviceController` interface to include `Destroyable`
- Rename `MeetingSessionPOSTLogger` to `POSTLogger`.
- Update `POSTLogger` to implement the `Logger` interface.
- Remove `MeetingSessionConfiguration` dependency from `MeetingSessionPOSTLogger`.
  Builders need to add `metadata` to `POSTLogger` if they want to include information such as `appName`, `meetingId` and so on with the HTTP POST request made by `POSTLogger` when sending logs to builder provided URL.
  Please check 3.0 migration guide for more information.
- Decoupled `EventController` from `AudioVideo` and `MeetingSession`.

### Fixed

- Fix a bug where joining without selecting any audio device failed when Web Audio is enabled.
- Fix a minor log info for video input ended event where we say resetting to null device when we just stop the video
  input.

## [3.0.0-beta.2] - 2022-03-09

### Added

- Added support for use of replicated meetings to extend meeting sizes to up to 10k view only participants with glareless promotion ability. See the Chime Developer Guide and the [JS SDK guide](https://aws.github.io/amazon-chime-sdk-js/modules/replicatedmeetings.html) for more details.

### Removed

- Remove `StatsCollector` interface.
- Remove `ClientMetricReport` interface.
- Remove `clientMetricReport` parameter from `StatsCollector.start()` API.
- Remove synthesize video APIs such as SMTP.

### Changed

- Rename `DefaultStatsCollector` to `StatsCollector`.
- Rename `DefaultClientMetricReport` to `ClientMetricReport`.
- Change `chooseAudioInputDevice` to explicit APIs `startAudioInput` and `stopAudioInput`. Application will need to
  call `stopVideoInput` at the end of the call to explicitly stop active audio stream.
- Change `chooseVideoInputDevice` to explicit APIs `startVideoInput` and `stopVideoInput`. Application will need to
  call `stopVideoInput` now to explicitly stop active video stream.
- Minor name change to `chooseAudioOutputDevice` to `chooseAudioOutput`.
- `startVideoPreviewForVideoInput` and `stopVideoPreviewForVideoInput` will no longer turn on and off video stream.
  This allows applications to join meeting without reselecting video again.
- Remove max bandwidth kbps parameter in `chooseVideoInputQuality` as it is not related to device. Applications can
  set video max bandwidth kbps from `audioVideo.setVideoMaxBandwidthKbps`.
- Rename `MeetingSessionPOSTLogger` to `POSTLogger`.
- Update `POSTLogger` to implement the `Logger` interface.
- Remove `MeetingSessionConfiguration` dependency from `MeetingSessionPOSTLogger`.
  Builders need to add `metadata` to `POSTLogger` if they want to include information such as `appName`, `meetingId` and so on with the HTTP POST request made by `POSTLogger` when sending logs to builder provided URL.
  Please check 3.0 migration guide for more information.

### Fixed

## [3.0.0-beta.1] - 2022-02-23

### Added

- Add compression support when sending and receiving sdp messages.
- Add automatic language identification support from Amazon Transcribe for live transcription APIs.
- Add `rtcStatsReport` property to `DefaultClientMetricReport` to store raw [`RTCStatsReport`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCStatsReport) and expose it via `metricsDidReceive` event.

### Removed

- Removed SDP interface.
- Remove [legacy (non-promise-based) `getStats` API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCPeerConnection/getStats#obsolete_syntax) call in `DefaultStatsCollector`. This API was previously used to obtain WebRTC metrics only for Chromium-based browsers. Now SDK obtains WebRTC metrics for all browsers via [standardized (promise-based) `getStats` API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCPeerConnection/getStats#syntax).
- Remove `browserBehavior` from the constructor of `DefaultStatsCollector`.

### Changed

- Change `resolveSpec` and `resolveOptions` in BackgroundBlurVideoFrameProcessor and BackgroundReplacementVideoFrameProcessor to clone parameter objects.

### Fixed

- Clone the video preference input in `chooseRemoteVideoSources` API in `VideoPriorityBasedPolicy` to avoid mutation that can cause video preferences to not be sorted and lead to wrong video subscription determination by the policy.
- Fix a screen share issue by resetting the sdp compression state during join requests.
- Fix a video orientation issue when Background Blur/Background Replacement is enabled.

## [3.0.0-beta.0] - 2022-02-08

### Added

### Removed

- Remove support for Plan B as well as Safari (and iOS) 12+. The minimum Safari and iOS supported version is now 13. Also clean up all plan-B code path.
- Remove all deprecated meeting status code.

### Changed

- Decoupled `EventController` from `AudioVideo` and `MeetingSession`.
- Add support for pre-release in Versioning.
- Removed upward BWE throttling logic in VideoPriorityBasedPolicyConfig, which was increasing recovery time more then intended, whereas its main focus was towards slowing downturns in BWE when the network is actually stable. We may come back to configuring the recovery delay another time.
- Add support for aws-sdk js v3 for messaging session.

### Fixed

- Fix a worker resource leak with `BackgroundBlurProcessor` and `BackgroundReplacementProcessor`.

## [2.27.0] - 2022-01-27

### Added

### Removed

### Changed

- Changed `VideoPriorityBasedPolicyConfig` to be dependent on bandwidth fluctuation so that `VideoPriorityBasedPolicy` will not drop/resume video instantly when network bandwidth changes. (#1921).
- Adjust the recovery behavior of `VideoPriorityBasedPolicy` to not get stuck at low estimates, not overeact to spurious packet loss when probing, and not let the time between probes raise to 60 seconds (reduced to maximum of 30 seconds).

### Fixed

- Fix the reconnecting issue (#1985) by skipping the "close" event if it does not arrive in two seconds.
- Add a workaround to avoid 480p resolution scale down when there are 5-8 videos for the default video uplink policy for Chromium browsers version 98 on Windows and use 360p instead.

## [2.26.0] - 2022-01-14

### Added

### Removed

### Changed

- Made `SimulcastUplinkObserver.encodingSimulcastLayersDidChange` (_not_ `AudioVideoObserver.encodingSimulcastLayersDidChange`) synchronous.

### Fixed

- Fixed delays in advertising simulcast stream switches due to asynchronous and out of order checks.
- Fixed Firefox video tiles containing stale frames from previous transceivers by not attempting to reuse inactive transceivers. This switches to using `RTCRtpTransceiver.stop` when possible and may fix other incorrect tile bugs.
- Fix the bug that the max bandwidth set by the chooseVideoInputQuality API is ignored when the Chime SDK retries the connection.
- Added additional pausing of `MonitorTask` and `ReceiveVideoStreamIndexTask` to avoid modifying mutable state mid-subscribe.
- Fix the bug that the max bandwidth is ignored if the chooseVideoInputQuality API is called before starting a meeting.
- Use optional chaining to prevent an error from undefined transceiverEncoding in FF.

## [2.25.0] - 2022-01-11

### Added

- Ability to choose remote video sources in `AllHighestVideoBandwidthPolicy`. see [guide](https://aws.github.io/amazon-chime-sdk-js/modules/videolayout.html#downlink-policy).
- Add `BackgroundReplacementVideoFrameProcessor` that will create a `VideoFrameProcessor` to apply a background image to an outgoing video stream.

### Removed

### Fixed

- Correct the minimum supported Firefox version to `75` to match the official [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/chime/latest/dg/meetings-sdk.html#mtg-browsers).

### Changed

- Fixed inconsistent default maxBitrate values in the NScaleVideoUplinkBandwithPolicy constructor leading to the default ideal max bitrate not being honored.

### Changed

- Clarified comment in `DefaultSimulcastUplinkPolicy`.

## [2.23.1] - 2021-12-17

### Fixed

- Temporararily removed munging of layers allocation extension to mitigate Chrome M97 change which led to `setLocalDescription` failures. This was not yet being negotiated by the remote end, so this will not have any impact on media quality.

## [2.23.0] - 2021-11-22

### Added

- Add support for Echo Reduction when using Voice Focus.

### Removed

### Fixed

- Switched `DefaultSimulcastUplinkPolicy` non-simulcast mode's enabled stream to mitigate Chromium not reconfiguring encoder on reconnect when using the top stream. This impacts only the non-simulcast mode of the simulcast policy when is when there are 2 or less participants (not 2 or less senders).

### Changed

## [2.22.0] - 2021-11-18

### Added

- Fix `visibilitychange` typo in `InMemoryJSONEventBuffer`.

### Changed

- Ignore `enableUnifiedPlanForChromiumBasedBrowsers` value (i.e. treat as always equaling the current default value of `true`) in `MeetingSesstionConfiguration`. Chrome is [in the processing](https://groups.google.com/g/discuss-webrtc/c/UBtZfawdIAA/m/m-4wnVHXBgAJ) of deprecating and removing Plan-B which would cause breakage in applications still trying to use it. This will have no effect on SDK behavior` and has been the default since 1.17.0.
- Change `appVersionName` and `appVersionCode` fields to `appName` and `appVersion` respectively.
- Update similar log messages in `DefaultMessagingSession` and `DefaultSignalingClient`.

## [2.20.1] - 2021-10-27

- Add `securitypolicyviolation` event listener to listen for CSP violations. If customers have set up CSP for their app, the event listener will detect violations and print warnings.

### Removed

- Remove Getting Started documentation guide and use [API overview](https://aws.github.io/amazon-chime-sdk-js/modules/apioverview.html) to cover the development in more details.
- Remove interface matching rule for all the components so that it is not required to have an interface of the same name for each component directory.

### Fixed

- Amazon Voice Focus now works in Chrome 95 or later: WebAssembly policy changes required a change in how modules were loaded. This requires additional Content Security Policy changes, which are documented in the [CSP guide](https://aws.github.io/amazon-chime-sdk-js/modules/contentsecurity_policy.html) and the [Amazon Voice Focus guide](https://aws.github.io/amazon-chime-sdk-js/modules/amazonvoice_focus.html).

- Added support for skipping full SDP renegotiations when switching simulcast streams. This will result in less freezing when switching between layers in response to a network event as done in `VideoPriorityBasedPolicy`. This will have no impact if not using simulcast.
- Add link to SIP Media Application examples in README.

### Removed

### Fixed

- Add safeguard for Nscale policy in case we increase to more than 25 videos.

### Changed

- Move `toLowerCasePropertyNames` inside `Utils.ts` and add test coverage.
- Reduced uplink resubscription when only stream encoding is changed by adding bypassing path.
- The browser demo now offers a configuration menu on each video tile. This menu replaces the 'Pin' button, which previously set the priority of the corresponding remote video to 1, and then rest to 2. The new configuration menu allows the user to specify the desired video quality and priority, which will be respected by simulcast and priority downlink policies. This is useful for testing or to demonstrate the behavior of those policies.
- Switched to using Web Components for video tiles in the browser demo.
- Migrate SauceLabs mobile tests to new api.

## [2.17.0] - 2021-09-08

### Added

- Add `audioInputMuteStateChanged` to the `DeviceChangeObserver` interface. This is called whenever the device is changed or is muted or unmuted, allowing applications to adapt to OS-level mute state for input devices.
- Added Android WebView Sample UI test to workflow.
- Add a new optional API `getVideoTileForAttendeeId` in `VideoTileController` and raise the `tileWillBePausedByDownlinkPolicy` event for empty video tiles.
- Amazon Voice Focus will now trigger the `onCPUWarning` method on the `VoiceFocusTransformDeviceDelegate` when using the default inline execution mode. This will be called when the browser fails to schedule the worklet in a timely fashion (_e.g._, when the meeting code is running in an iframe /subframe) or when changes in the CPU environment (_e.g._, thermal throttling) cause the worklet to take too long for each audio render quantum.
- Amazon Voice Focus will now trigger the `voiceFocusInsufficientResources` method on the `VoiceFocusTransformDeviceDelegate` when using the default inline execution mode. This will be called when the browser fails to schedule the worklet in a timely fashion (_e.g._, when the meeting code is running in an iframe /subframe) or when changes in the CPU environment (_e.g._, thermal throttling) cause the worklet to take too long for each audio render quantum.
- Add retry logic in FAQs.

### Fixed

- Fix race condition in Safari when disconnect and connect stream from video element.

## [2.15.0] - 2021-08-04

### Added

- Supports integration with Amazon Transcribe and Amazon Transcribe Medical for live transcription. The Amazon Chime Service uses its active talker algorithm to select the top two active talkers, and sends their audio to Amazon Transcribe (or Amazon Transcribe Medical) in your AWS account. User-attributed transcriptions are then sent directly to every meeting attendee via data messages. Use transcriptions to overlay subtitles, build a transcript, or perform real-time content analysis. For more information, visit [the live transcription guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/chime/latest/dg/meeting-transcription.html).
- [Demo] Add live transcription functionality. You will need to have a serverless deployment to create new AWS Lambda endpoints for live transcription. Follow [the live transcription guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/chime/latest/dg/meeting-transcription.html) to create necessary service-linked role so that the demo app can call Amazon Transcribe and Amazon Transcribe Medical on your behalf.
- Exposed Amazon Voice Focus model complexity as a type in order to support
  showcasing complexity limitation in the meeting demo.
- Packet-per-second (PPS) logging is now enabled in the meeting demo by
  default. If the browser sends an incorrect packet rate, this will be logged
  as an error in the console.
- Add a warning log in `InMemoryJSONEventBuffer`'s `send` function when retrying starts.

### Changed

- Update `InMemoryJSONEventBuffer` to retry with backoff.

### Removed

### Added

- Bind tileController during the initialization of DefaultAudioVideoController for VideoPriorityBasedPolicy.
- Add more debug logging for choose input device.
- Add the meeting and device error sections in the meeting-event guide.
- Add a `forceUpdate` parameter to use when listing devices. In some cases, builders need to delay the triggering of permission dialogs, _e.g._, when joining a meeting in view-only mode, and then later be able to trigger a permission prompt in order to show device labels. This parameter allows cached device labels to be forcibly discarded and recomputed after the device label trigger is run.

### Changed

- Log error instead of throwing error if the signaling client is not ready to send data message.
- Now when `setDeviceLabelTrigger` is called, if the `deviceInfoCache` contains a device with no label, `deviceInfoCache` will be cleared.

### Removed

### Fixed

- Do not start local video tile if there is no stream for content share.

- Media streams are no longer discarded during reconnects. This fixes an issue
  where initial signaling connection failures could cause a client to be unable
  to join a meeting with audio if Web Audio were enabled.

## [2.9.0] - 2021-05-10

### Added

- Add the Messaging section in FAQs to describe how to receive messages
  without using the Chime SDK for JavaScript.
- `DefaultAudioVideoFacade.start` now takes an options argument. You can use
  this to trigger a signaling socket connection prior to device selection: call
  `audioVideo.start({ signalingOnly: true })`, and then later call
  `audioVideo.start()` as usual.
- Added a 'abort-on-reconnect' query parameter to demo URL to trigger fatal
  on reconnection for use in integration tests (default false).

### Changed

- `startVideoPreviewForVideoInput` uses the active video input stream instead
  of calling `getUserMedia` again.
- Meeting connections now do more work in parallel, which will improve
  meeting join times.

### Removed

### Fixed

- Fix `npm run start:hot` in the browser demo.

## [2.8.0] - 2021-04-23

### Added

- Added new downlink policy `VideoPriorityBasedPolicy`, providing the ability
  to explicitly request remote video sources to receive and set their respective priorities. See
  [this guide](https://aws.github.io/amazon-chime-sdk-js/modules/prioritybased_downlink_policy.html)
  for more details and a code walkthrough of using the new policy.
  _(Note that the exact internal behavior of this policy may slightly change in future releases.)_

  choppy for other participants when Web Audio was enabled. This workaround
  recreates the Web Audio context each time an input device is selected.

### Changed

- Update `SignalingProtocol` with optional video metric fields and optional join flags.
- `DefaultDeviceController` and `DefaultActiveSpeakerDetector` now conform to a
  new `Destroyable` interface, allowing resources to be explicitly discarded
  when a meeting is over.
- `MeetingSessionPOSTLogger` conforms to `Destroyable`. You should call
  `destroy` when you are done logging unless you plan to close the window.

### Removed

### Fixed

- Improve some unit tests.
- Fewer observers are now retained after meetings end. This should reduce
  leaks.
- Correctly close input streams when ending a call while using a video
  transform device.

## [2.6.2] - 2021-03-24

### Fixed

- Calling `realtimeSetLocalAudioInput` as part of `AudioVideoController.restartLocalAudio()` to
  fix local mute/unmute issue while switching audio devices.

## [2.6.1] - 2021-03-17

### Fixed

- Fix infinite loop when calling `chooseAudioInputDevice` with a

### Changed

### Removed

### Fixed

## [2.2.1] - 2020-12-11

### Added

### Changed

### Removed

### Fixed

- Binding audio elements will no longer throw an error unless calling code is
  trying to choose an output device in a browser that does not support

- [Demo] Add audio quality settings to meeting demo.

### Changed

- The project now produces ES2015 output, rather than ES5 output that refers to ES2015
  features. The SDK supports only modern browsers, and is increasingly dependent on ES2015
  features. This change leads to more compact bundles and aligns the supported JavaScript
  language variant with the supported runtime features.

  If you need your built application bundle to target browsers that do not
  support ES2015 syntax, including Internet Explorer, you will need to transpile the SDK code
  using a transpiler like Babel, or split your application bundle into multiple files that can
  be conditionally loaded. Note that transpiling some parts of the SDK might result in ES5 code
