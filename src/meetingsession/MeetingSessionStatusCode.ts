/**
 * [[MeetingSessionStatusCode]] gives the underlying reason for a given [[MeetingSessionStatus]]. Though some codes are used for
 * [[MeetingSessionStatus]] internally, the primary use of these is in `AudioVideoObserver.audioVideoDidStop`, and their docstrings
 * will be specific to that usage. Other functions that use [[MeetingSessionStatus]] (mainly
 * `AudioVideoControllerFacade.promoteToPrimaryMeeting` and `AudioVideoObserver.audioVideoWasDemotedFromPrimaryMeeting` will document
 * their usage separately).
 *
 * These status codes can be used for logging, debugging, and notification to end users, but in most cases should not
 * be used for any retry behavior, as the audio video controller will already be retrying non-terminal errors (i.e. regardless
 * of `MeetingSessionStatus.isTerminal`, your application should not try to immediately restart or recreate the
 * audio video controller). For error codes that indicate issues with the Chime service, please create a github issue
 * with browser logs if they occur frequently.
 *
 * If `MeetingSessionStatus.isTerminal` returns `true`, you should remove any meeting UX in addition to notifying the user,
 * as the audio video controller will not be retrying the connection. When notifying users, more general failure messages are
 * recommended unless otherwise noted.
